# Framework Integration Reference

Read only the section matching the consuming project. Framework APIs evolve; confirm routing hooks and server boundaries against the installed framework version before editing.

## Detection

| Signal | Framework |
|---|---|
| `next.config.*` plus `next` dependency | Next.js |
| `svelte.config.*` plus `@sveltejs/kit` | SvelteKit |
| `@tanstack/react-start` and its Vite/Rsbuild plugin | TanStack Start |
| `astro.config.*` plus `astro` | Astro |
| Browser entry plus server/API entry without the above | Framework-neutral TypeScript |

## Shared rules

- Keep `events.ts` environment-neutral and import only root event helpers from `trakoo`.
- Import the same registry value in client and server modules:

```ts
import { appEvents } from "./events";

const analytics = createClientAnalytics({
	events: appEvents,
	providers: clientProviders,
});

const serverAnalytics = createServerAnalytics({
	events: appEvents,
	providers: serverProviders,
});
```

- Put `createClientAnalytics` and browser providers in a browser-only module.
- Put `createServerAnalytics`, server providers, and secrets in a server-only module.
- Track a business event where it becomes authoritative, not merely where navigation happens.
- Use the framework's public-variable convention only for browser-safe provider identifiers.

## Next.js

Use a client component for browser initialization, identity lifecycle, and navigation effects. Import `appEvents` and pass it as the factory's `events` option. Browser values use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`; unprefixed values remain server-only. Put critical tracking in route handlers, server actions, or other server-only modules and pass the same registry to the server factory. Await critical events. Call `shutdown()` in the request's `finally` block only when that request created and owns a fresh provider/analytics pair. A reusable module singleton stays alive across requests and shuts down only at application or process teardown. Verify with `next build` because it catches accidental server imports in client bundles.

## SvelteKit

Initialize browser analytics only in browser-executed code such as `onMount`; import `appEvents` and pass it to the client factory. Keep server providers in `+page.server.ts`, `+server.ts`, hooks, or other server-only modules and pass the same registry to the server factory. Use `$env/static/public` or `$env/dynamic/public` for client-safe values and private `$env/*/private` modules only on the server. Use the installed SvelteKit navigation API for page views and avoid double-counting the initial navigation.

## TanStack Start

Enforce the runtime boundary with filenames such as `analytics.client.ts` and `analytics.server.ts`. As an additional or alternative guard, put the matching side-effect marker at the top of each module:

```ts
// analytics.client.ts
import "@tanstack/react-start/client-only";
```

```ts
// analytics.server.ts
import "@tanstack/react-start/server-only";
```

Place browser analytics in client-executed application code and server analytics inside `createServerFn` handlers or server routes. Import the shared `appEvents` registry on both sides and pass `events: appEvents` to each factory. Keep `.server.ts` helpers imported only inside a server-function handler or another compiler-recognized server callback:

```ts
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { z } from "zod";

const trackPurchaseInput = z.object({
	orderId: z.string().min(1),
});

export const trackPurchase = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
	.validator(trackPurchaseInput)
	.handler(async ({ data }) => {
		const { createRequestAnalytics } = await import("./analytics.server");
		const { requireUser } = await import("./auth.server");
		const { purchases } = await import("./purchases.server");

		const user = await requireUser();
		const order = await purchases.confirmAndLoad({
			orderId: data.orderId,
			userId: user.id,
		});
		const projectKey = process.env.POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY!;
		const analytics = createRequestAnalytics(projectKey);

		try {
			await analytics.track(
				"purchase_completed",
				{
					orderId: order.id,
					amount: order.totalAmount,
					currency: order.currency,
				},
				{
					userId: user.id,
					user: {
						email: user.email,
						traits: { plan: order.plan },
					},
				},
			);
		} finally {
			await analytics.shutdown();
		}
	});
```

`requireUser` and `purchases.confirmAndLoad` are seams supplied by the consuming application. Authenticate inside the server function, then use the lookup ID plus the authenticated user ID to load and confirm the authoritative purchase. Derive event properties and identity from that server-owned result and session; never accept event properties, user identity, or traits from the browser for an authoritative event.

With Vite, expose only browser-safe identifiers through `VITE_*`. Read unprefixed deployment environment values inside `.handler()`, middleware `.server()`, server-route handlers, or other per-request callbacks. Edge runtimes may expose deployment bindings differently from Node's `process.env`; use the installed adapter's per-request binding API.

Choose one page-view owner. The following router-owned approach requires the client `PostHogClientProvider` to use `capture_pageview: false` before the manual initial/navigation stream. If provider auto-capture owns page views, omit this stream. Export the retained client initialization promise as `analyticsReady`, and await it before emitting or recording the initial URL. Normalize initial and router URLs identically so relative and absolute hrefs deduplicate.

The route-mounted tracker is isomorphic because a root route participates in SSR. It must not be named `*.client.tsx` or carry the client-only side-effect marker. Instead, keep `analytics.client.ts` import-protected and put its dynamic import plus all browser-only setup behind TanStack Start's compiler-recognized `createClientOnlyFn` boundary:

```tsx
// PageViewTracker.tsx — isomorphic and safe to import from an SSR root route
import { createClientOnlyFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const startPageViews = createClientOnlyFn((router: ReturnType<typeof useRouter>) => {
	let lastPageUrl: string | undefined;
	let unsubscribe: (() => void) | undefined;
	let disposed = false;

	async function start() {
		const { analytics, analyticsReady } = await import("./analytics.client");

		function emitPageView(href: string) {
			const parsed = new URL(href, window.location.origin);
			parsed.hash = "";
			const url = parsed.href;

			if (url === lastPageUrl) return;
			lastPageUrl = url;

			analytics.pageView({
				path: `${parsed.pathname}${parsed.search}`,
				url,
			});
		}

		await analyticsReady;
		if (disposed) return;

		emitPageView(window.location.href);
		unsubscribe = router.subscribe("onResolved", ({ toLocation }) => {
			emitPageView(toLocation.href);
		});
	}

	void start();

	return () => {
		disposed = true;
		unsubscribe?.();
	};
});

export function PageViewTracker() {
	const router = useRouter();
	useEffect(() => startPageViews(router), [router]);
	return null;
}
```

Mount that isomorphic component once in the long-lived root route:

```tsx
// routes/__root.tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { PageViewTracker } from "./PageViewTracker";

export const Route = createRootRoute({ component: RootComponent });

function RootComponent() {
	return (
		<>
			<Outlet />
			<PageViewTracker />
		</>
	);
}
```

The effect cleanup marks a pending initialization as disposed before it can install the subscription, and calls `unsubscribe()` after installation. Apply the same one-owner decision to page-leave tracking; disable provider auto-capture before manually emitting page leaves. Confirm the consuming project's installed TanStack Start version exports `createClientOnlyFn` with this signature, then run its type checker and production build; those checks catch unsupported APIs and import-protection violations.

## Astro

Initialize client analytics in a processed `<script>` or a hydrated UI-framework island, importing the shared registry and passing `events: appEvents`. Use the retained initialization promise, exported as `analyticsReady` from the browser analytics module. Use `PUBLIC_*`/`astro:env/client` only for browser-safe values and `astro:env/server` for server provider secrets. Put critical tracking in endpoints, actions, middleware, or other server-rendered code and pass the same registry to the server factory. With Astro's client router, listen for completed navigations and await readiness before each page view:

```ts
import { analytics, analyticsReady } from "./analytics.client";

document.addEventListener("astro:page-load", async () => {
	await analyticsReady;
	analytics.pageView({ path: window.location.pathname, url: window.location.href });
});
```

Ensure a persistent script or guarded setup registers the listener once so client navigation does not multiply page views.

## Framework-neutral TypeScript

Create one browser-owned instance from the application's browser entry and one server factory or request-scoped instance from server code. Import the same `appEvents` value and pass it to every factory. A short-lived request may call `shutdown()` in `finally` only for the fresh provider/analytics pair it created and owns; a reusable module singleton shuts down only at application or process teardown. Use the build tool's public environment prefix (`VITE_*` for Vite by default). Subscribe to the chosen router's completed-navigation event rather than click events, because redirects and history navigation also change pages.

## Verification

Run the framework's typecheck and production build. Confirm browser output contains no server provider import or secret name. Exercise initial load, client navigation, login, logout, and one critical server event; ensure each expected event is emitted once.
