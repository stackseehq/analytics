## Learning Path

If you're new to @stacksee/analytics, we recommend reading these guides in order:

1. **Events** - Start here to understand how to define and track events
2. **Providers** - Learn how events get delivered to analytics services
3. **Client vs Server** - Understand when and how to track in different environments
4. **Type Safety** - Master TypeScript features for error-free tracking

## Prerequisites

Before diving into these concepts, make sure you've:

- ✅ Completed [Your First Event](/docs/your-first-event) tutorial
- ✅ Installed @stacksee/analytics and at least one provider
- ✅ Have a basic understanding of TypeScript

## Quick Reference

### Event Definition Pattern

```typescript
export const appEvents = {
  eventName: {
    name: 'event_name',
    category: 'category',
    properties: {} as {
      // Type-safe properties
    }
  }
} as const satisfies EventCollection<Record<string, CreateEventDefinition<string>>>;
```

### Client-Side Tracking

```typescript
import { analytics } from '@/lib/analytics';

// Track event
analytics.track('eventName', { /* properties */ });

// Identify user
analytics.identify('user-id', { /* traits */ });

// Reset on logout
analytics.reset();
```

### Server-Side Tracking

```typescript
import { serverAnalytics } from '@/lib/server-analytics';

// Track with user context
await serverAnalytics.track('eventName', { /* properties */ }, {
  userId: 'user-id',
  user: { /* user data */ }
});

// Always shutdown in serverless
await serverAnalytics.shutdown();
```

## Common Questions

### When should I use client-side vs server-side tracking?

- **Client-side**: User interactions, page views, UI events
- **Server-side**: API calls, background jobs, critical events

See [Client vs Server](/docs/core-concepts/client-vs-server) for detailed guidance.

### How do I use multiple analytics providers?

Add them to the `providers` array when creating your analytics instance:

```typescript
const analytics = createClientAnalytics({
  providers: [
    new PostHogClientProvider({ token: 'xxx' }),
    new BentoClientProvider({ siteUuid: 'xxx' })
  ]
});
```

Events are automatically sent to all providers. See [Providers](/docs/core-concepts/providers) for more.

### How does type safety work?

TypeScript infers event names and properties from your event definitions. This gives you autocomplete and compile-time errors for typos or wrong property types. See [Type Safety](/docs/core-concepts/type-safety) for the full picture.
